# schoolapp-app

Alpha version of an app for my school. To install the dev environment, simply install yarn and npm. Then install react-native-cli using npm.

Finally, we are able to download and initialize the project.
```
git clone
yarn install
react-native link
```

To start the dev server, issue
```
react-native start
```

Then, depending on your platform, either
```
react-native run-android
```
or 
```
react-native run-ios
```

Both of these commands require setup of Android Studio and XCode, respectively.
